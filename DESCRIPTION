Description: Here we performs robust hierarchical co-clustering between row and column entities of a data matrix in 
             absence and presence of outlying observations. It can be used to explore important co-clusters consisting of  
             important samples and their regulatory significant features. For example, this package co-cluster the genes and 
             DCCs and detect biomarker co-clusters efficiently. The toxicogenomic biomarker genes and their regulatory DCCs 
             can be explored from these biomarker co-clusters please see Hasan et al., 2020 <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.094946>.
