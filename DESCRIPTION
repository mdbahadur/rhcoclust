Description: Here we performs robust hierarchical co-clustering between row and column entities of a data matrix in 
             absence and presence of outlying observations. It can be used to explore important co-clusters consisting of  
             important samples and their regulatory significant features. Please see Hasan, Badsha and Mollah (2020)
